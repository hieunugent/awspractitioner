# AWS Practitioner
## what is cloud computing?
- what is cloud computing 
  - cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power,database storage, application, and other IT resources.
  - pay as you go pricing 
  - provision exactly the type and size of computing
  -  almost istantly for your demand
  - simple way access server, storage, databases and a set of application service
  - AWS will maintains the network connected hardware required for these application 
- private cloud:
  - cloud service uses by a single org not exposed to the public 
  - complete control
  - security for sensitive app
  - meet specific business needs
- public cloud:(azure, AWS, Google cloud)
  - cloud resouces owned and operate by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
  - six advantages of cloud computing 
- hybrid cloud:
  - keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud
  - control over sensitive asset in your private infrastructure
  - flexibility and cost effectiveness of the public cloud
- Five Characteristics of cloud Computing
  - On-demand self service
  - Broad network access
  - multi- tenancy and resourse pooling 
  - rapid elasticity and
  - measured service
- Six advantage of Cloud computing
  - Trade capial expense(CAPEX) for operational expense(OPEX): pay on demain, dont own hardware, reduce total cost of ouwnership TCO and Opreational Expense (OPEX)
  - benefit from massive economies of scale : price are reduced as AWS is more efficienent due to large scale
  - Stop guesing capacity 
  - increase speed and agility
  - stop spending money running and maintainging data center
  - go global in minutes: leverage the AWS globale infrastureture
- problem solver by cloud:
  - Flexibility: change resourse types when needed
  - cost effectiveness: pay ass you go
  - Scalability : accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional node
  - elasticity: ability to scale out and scale in when needed
  - high-availibility and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
  - Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software application 
  
## The diff Types of Cloud Computing 
- type of cloud comp.
  - infrastructure as a service(IaaS)
    - provide building block for IT
    - Provides networking, computers data storage space
    - highest level of flexibity
    - easy parallel with traditional onpremise IT
  - Platform as a Service(PaaS)
    - remove the need fr your organation to manage the underlying infrastructure 
    - Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
  - Software as a service (SaaS)
     - completeed product that is run and manger by the service provider

- example of CLoud Computing Types
  - infrastructure as a service: Amazon EC2, GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Linode
  - Platform as a service : Elastic Beanstalk(on AWS), Heroku, Google app Engine (GCP), Azure
  - Softwarea as a service : Many AWS service (ex: Rekognition for ML), Goole app. Gropbox, Zoom 
- Pricing of the cloud   
  - Compute
  - storage
  - data transfer Out of the cloud
- use cases includage
  - Enterprise IT, Backup store Big Data Analytics
  - website hosting Mobile and Social APPs, Gaming 
- AWS Global INfrastructure
    - regions: cluter of data centers, most AWS services are region-scoped
    - availability Zones:
      - each region has many availability zones ussualy 3 min 2 max 6 : ap-southeast-2a, ap-southest-2b
      - each available zone is one or more discrete data cneter with redundant power, networing and connectivity
      - they are separate form each other , so that they area isolate from disaster
      - they area connected with highbandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
    - Data Centers, Edge Locations, Points Of presense 
    - How to choose an AWS region:
        - Compliance with data governance and legal requirements : data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
        - proximity to customers: reduced latency 
        - Available services within a region: new services and new feature aren't available in every Region 
        - pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
- SHAre Responsebility:

## IAM - Identity and Access Management
- IAM: USers & Groups
    - IAM = Identity and Access Management, Globoal service
    - Root Accountr created by default shouldn't e used or shared
    - users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
    - groups only contain users not other groups
    - users dont have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups
    ![alt text](https://github.com/hieunugent/awspractitioner/blob/main/groups.JPG?raw=true)

- IAM: Permissions
    - Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
    - these policies define the permission of the users
    - In AWS you apply the least privilege principle : dont give more permissions than a user needs
- IAM : policies:
    ![alt text](https://github.com/hieunugent/awspractitioner/blob/main/IAMpolicy.JPG?raw=true)
    ![alt text](https://github.com/hieunugent/awspractitioner/blob/main/policysStructure.JPG?raw=true)
- IAM - Password policy
   - Strong passwords = higher security for your account 
   - In AWS, you can setup a password policy 
      - set a munimum password length 
      - require specific character types
      - allow all IAM users to change their own password 
      - requires users to change their password 
      - require user change password after sometime
      - prevent password reuse
   - Multi Factor Authentication - MFA
      - user have access to your account and can change config or delete resource in your AWS 
      - you want to protect your root account and IAM user 
      - MFA = password + security device you own 
       ![alt text](https://github.com/hieunugent/awspractitioner/blob/main/MFA.JPG?raw=true)
      - main benefit of MFA: if password is stolen or hacked the account is not compromised
- HOw can users access AWS
  - three option to access AWS:
    - Aws Management console : protect by password and MFA
    - AWS command line interface (CLI) : protect by access keys
    - AWS software DEveloper kit (SDK) for code protected by access keys
  - Access keys are generated through the Aws Console
  - Users Manage theri own access keys
  - Access keys are secret, just like a password 
- what is AWS CLI ?
  - tool to interact with AWS serevice using commmands in command-line shell
  - direct access to the public APIs of AWS services
  - can develop scripts to manage your resources
- what is the SDK ?
  - AWS software development kit
  - language specific APIs
  - enable you to access and manage AWS sevices programmatically 
  - Embedded within your application 
  - supports :
    - SDKs(java , python , PHP, .Net, JS, Go , NOde.js, C++)
    - Mobile SDKs
    - IOT Devices SDKs (Embedded C,  Arduino, ...) 
- IAM roles for services
  - somw AWS service will need to perform actions on your befhalf
  - to do so we will assign permisssions to Aws service with IAM roles 
  - common roles : EC2 instance Role Lambda Function Roles, ROle For Clound Formation 
   ![alt text](https://github.com/hieunugent/awspractitioner/blob/main/IAMroles.JPG?raw=true)
- IAM Security Tools
  - Iam Credential Report (account level)
     - a repost taht lst all your accounts user and the status of their various credential 
  - Iam Access Advisor user level
    - access advisor show the service permissions granted to a user and when those serviece wre last access 
    - you can use this information to revise your policies
- Shared Resposibility MOdel For IAM

## EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
- Amazopn EC2
  - EC2 is one of the most pouylar of AWS offering 
  - EC2 is Elastic compute cloud is infrastructure as a service
  - it mainly consists in the capability of :
    - renting virtual machines (EC2)
    - storing data virtual drive EBS
    - distributing load across machines ELB
    - Scaling the services using an auto scaling group
  - Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the cloud works
 - EC2 sizing and configuration options
    - OS : linux win Mac
    - how much compute power and cores CPU
    - how much random access memory Ram
    - how much storage space :
      - Network attachhed (EBS and EFS)
      - hardware (Ec2 Instance store)
    - Network card speed of the card public IP Address
    - firewall rules security group
    - Bootraps Scipt( configure at first launch ) : EC2 User Data
 - EC2 Users Data
    - It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 USer data Script
    - Bootstrapping means launching acommands when a machine starts
    - that scropts is only run once at the instance first Start
    - EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
      - installing updates 
      - installing software
      - downloading common files  from the internet
      - anything you can think of
    - it run with Root user
- EC2 INstance typ example

     - Storage Optimizes
        - Great for storage intensive tasks that require high sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage 
        - use cases:
          - hihg frequency online transaction procesing (OLTP) systems
          - realtional and NOSQL databases
          - cache fpr in memory database 
          - Data warehouseing appilcations

- Introduction to security Groups
  - security groups are the fundamental of network security In AWS
  - they control how traddic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances
  - ![securitygroup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122133611-eb189000-cdf1-11eb-87f8-2d7acecb8d45.JPG)

  - only contain allow rules
  - rules can reference by IP or by Security Group
  - Security group acting as a firewall on EC2 instances
  - they regulate: 
      - access to ports
      - authoriesd IP ranges  - IPv4 and IPv6
      - control inbound network from other to the instance
      - control outbound network from instance to other
  - ![securitryDiagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122134037-b78a3580-cdf2-11eb-9fe1-fdcd1118112c.JPG)
  - good to know:
    - can be attached to multiple instance
    - locked down to a region /VPC combination
    - live outside the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance wont see it 
    - it good to maintain one separate security group for ssh access
    - if your application is not accessible (timeout), then it's a security group issue
    - if give a " connectio refused error, then it's an application error opr it's not lauched 
    - by default all inbound traffic is block 
    - all outbound traffic is authoried
    - ![securitygroupdiagram2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122134584-c1606880-cdf3-11eb-9f6f-bec94db45f16.JPG)

- EC2 Instances Purchasing Options:
  - On-demand Instances : short workload, predictable pricing
  - ![ondemainprice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122138926-a47c6300-cdfc-11eb-9a80-70f8b40bb97c.JPG)

  - reserved: (minimum 1 year)
    - reserved instances : long workloads 
    - convertible reserverd Instances : Long workloads with flexible instance
    - schedule reserved instances: example - every thursday between 3 adn 6pm 
    - ![resinstanceprice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122139140-2a001300-cdfd-11eb-899e-98508e2f7f09.JPG)

  - spot instances: short wrkloads, cheap can lose instance (less reliable)
  - ![spotinstanceprice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122139279-7e0af780-cdfd-11eb-8a0b-0312b53166e4.JPG)

  - dedicate  Instance:
    - instances running on hardware that dedicated to you 
    - may share hardware with other instances in same account 
    - no control over instance placement (can move hardware after STop/ Start)
    - ![comparededicate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122139707-6d0eb600-cdfe-11eb-89c3-2f700872111c.JPG)

- What is an EBS volume?
  - An EBS (Elastic Block STore) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run 
  - It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination 
  - They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level) , CCP: Certified Cloud Practitioner - onw EBS can be only mounted to one EC2 instance Associate level (Solutions Architect, DEveloper, SysOps ):"Multi-attach" Feature for some EBS
  - they are bound to a specific availability Zone
  - Analogy : Think of them as a Network USB stick
  - free tier: 30 GB of free EBS Storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or  Magnetic per MOnth
- EBS Volume:
  - It's a network drive:
    - it uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency 
    - it can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly 
  - It's Locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
    - An EBS volume in Us-east-1 a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
    - to move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
  - Have a provisioned capacity(size in GbS, and IOPS)
    - you get billed for all the provisioned capacity
    - you can increase the capacity of the drive over time
  - EBS delete on termination attribute
    - controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instace terminates
      - by default, the root EBs volume is delleted (attribute enabled)
      - by default, any other attached EBS volume is not Deleled ( Attribute Disable)
    - this can be controlled by The AWS console/ AWS CLI
    - use case : preserve root volume when instance is terminated
- EBS Snapshots
    - make a backup of your EBS volume at a point in time
    - Nopt neccessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
    - can copy snapshots across AZ or REgions
    - ![snapshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122657067-f7179100-d114-11eb-9667-a2bbd07098ec.JPG)
- AMI Overview:
    - AMI = Amazon Machine Image
    - AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
      - you add your own software, configuration, operation system, monitoring
      - Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged 
    - AMI are built for a specific region and can be copied across regions
    - you can launch EC2 instance from :
      - A public AMI: AWS provided
      - your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
      - An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)
- AMI Process (from an EC2 instance)
    - Start an EC2 instance and customize it 
    - Stop the instance for data integrity
    - Build an AMI - This will also create EBS snapshots 
    - launch instances from other AMIs
    - ![AMIprocess](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122663544-0a941d80-d150-11eb-9dfb-8ba212c05787.JPG)

- EC2 Image Builder
    - Used to automate the creation of Virtual Machines or container images
    - => Automate the creation , maintain , validate and test EC2 AMIs
    - can be run on a schedule (weekly, or whenever packages are updated, etc..)
    - free service (only pay for underlying resources )
    - ![buildimageAMI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/122663922-ceae8780-d152-11eb-8570-c7a923ee2fec.JPG)
- EC2 Instance Store
  - EBS volume are network drives with good but "limited" Performance
  - If you need a high-performance hardware disk , use EC2 Intance Store
  - Better I/O performance
  - Ec2 Instance Store lose theor storage if they are stopped (ephemeral)
  - Good for buffer/cache/scatch data/temporary content
  - risk of data loss if hardware fail
  - Backups and Replication are your RESPONSIBLE
- EFS -Elastic File SYstems
  - Managed NFS that can be mounted on 100s of EC2
  - EFS works with linux EC2 intances in multi-AZ
  - highly available , scalable expensice (3x gp2, pay per use, no capacity planning
  - ![efs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/124177256-d3354300-da64-11eb-9364-ba930e89edfd.JPG)

- EFS infrequent Access (EFS-IA)
  - storage class that is cost optimized for file not accessed every day
  - up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
  - EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA base on the last time they were accessed
  - Enable EFS-IA with a lifeCycle Policy
  - Example: move files that are not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA
  - Transparent to applications accessing EFS
  - ![EFS-IA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/124201735-97fb3a00-da8d-11eb-9b7d-d9db66406976.JPG)

- High Availability Scalability, Elasticity 
  - scalability means that an application / systems can handle greater loads by adapting 
  - there are two kinds of scalability:
    - Vertical Scalability
    - Horizontal Scalabity(+ elasticity)
  - Scalability is linked but differeant to high Availability
- Vertivcal Scalabil;ity:
  - vertical scalability means increasing the size of the instance
  - for example your application runs on a t2.micro
  - scaling that application vvertically means running ity on a t2.large
  - vertical scalability  is very common for non distributed systemsuch as a database
  - there usually a limmit to how much you can vertically scale
- horizontal scalability :
  - means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application  
  - horizontal scaling implies distributed systems
  - this is very common for web application modern application 
  - its is easy to horizontalliy scale thank teh cloud offering such as AMazon EC2
- high Availability 
  - high available usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling 
  - high available means running your application /system in at least 2 availability zones
  - the goal of the high availability is to survive a data center loss
- scalability : ability to accommodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger scale up or by adding nodes sacle out
- elasicity once a system is scalable elasticity means that there will be some autoscaling so that the system can scale beesase on the load. this is cloud friendly, pay per use , match demand , optimize costs
- Agility : not related to scalability - distractor new It resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resource available to your developers from weeks to just minute
- Elastic load balancing ELB Overview:
- what is load balancing?
  - load balanced ar3e servers that forward internet traffic to multiple server(EC2 instances) downstream
  - ![loadbalancer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860697/125679229-01ff265e-ae89-4432-8530-960cad864b26.JPG)
- why use a load balancer?
  - spread load across multiple downstream instances
  - expose a single point of access DNS to your application
  - seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
  - do regular health checks to your instance
  - provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
  - high availability across zones
